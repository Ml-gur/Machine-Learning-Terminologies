# Machine-Learning-Terminologies
- Observation- this is a single collection  of predictors and target variables. 
   - A target variable can also be termed as output variable and refers to the variables we #INTEND to #Model. Target variables are DEPENDENT
   - for you to model the target variables, you use #INPUT VARIABLES also known as predictors or features. Input variables are INDEPENDENT

- Dataset- this involves multiple observations with same variables that are put together

	- there are three kinds of dataset namely:
		
		- Training Dataset - this is the dataset that is used to build a machine learning model
			-  the training dataset is assumed to always have N observations and D number of predictors
			-  the vector features for nth observation is denoted by Xn meaning that Xn include the functions in th original predictors. 			
		- Validation Dataset- this is the dataset that is used when comparing multiple models that have been built on same training dataset using different parameters
		- Testing Dataset- the dataset that is used to evaluate the final perfomance of the model
		- 


- Variable types
		- variables can either be categorical or quantitative:
				- Quantitative show a continuous or almost-continuous scale an example is the height of a person. 
				- Categorical are based on a discrete set of group
							
		- if the variables are quantitative then the modeling task is refered to as #Regression
		- while if te target is categorical the modeling is refered to as #classification
		

# Modeling Structure
			
 # Linear Regression
- Linear Regression is used to understand the relationship between input/predictors and output/targets numerical variables.
	- since it is a # Model, the model assumes that there is a linear relationship between a given input variable (x) and a single target variable (y). 
	- the target variable (y) is calculated from the Linear Combination of input variable (x). 
- Types of linear regression

- Simple Linear Regression - this is a type of regression when there is a single predictor variable (x)
- Multiple regression - this is when there are multiple predictor variables (x)
	
- it is both a statistical and machine learning algorithm
